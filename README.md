# DeepNanoHi-C

##  Overview

**DeepNanoHi-C** is a deep learning framework specifically developed for analyzing **single-cell long-read concatemer sequencing (scNanoHi-C)** data, a technology that enables high-resolution profiling of 3D chromatin structure in individual cells. Despite its potential, scNanoHi-C presents unique analytical challenges—such as sparsity, cell-specific variability, and complex chromatin interaction patterns—that are not fully addressed by existing scHi-C methods.

DeepNanoHi-C tackles these challenges through a **multi-step autoencoder architecture** combined with a **Sparse Gated Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)** model. This framework learns both global and cell-specific chromatin contact patterns, imputes sparse contact maps, and dynamically selects expert models based on distinct interaction features. It further employs a **dual-channel prediction network** to integrate multi-scale chromatin interactions and refine structural inferences.

This tool enables comprehensive and scalable analysis of single-cell chromatin conformation, providing new avenues for understanding genome organization at the single-cell level and across species.


##  Installation

To install and set up **DeepNanoHi-C**, please follow the steps below:

### 1. Clone the Repository 

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/DeepNanoHi-C.git
cd DeepNanoHi-C
```

### 2. Create and activate the conda environment
```bash
conda create -n deepnanohic python=3.9
conda activate deepnanohic
```

### 3. Install Dependencies
#### (1) Install PyTorch
Install PyTorch (>= 1.9.0) following the official instructions ([https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/)). We recommend using PyTorch 1.12.1.
#### (2) Install Required Packages
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Or install them individually:
```bash
pip install cooler h5py numpy pandas pytorch_tabnet scikit-learn scipy
```

##  Data Preparation

To run DeepNanoHi-C, please prepare the following input files:

#### 1. `data.txt`

A tab-separated file containing raw interaction records. Each row represents an interaction between two genomic bins in a single cell. The required columns are:

| Column Name | Description                          |
|-------------|--------------------------------------|
| `cell_id`   | Unique identifier of each cell       |
| `chrom1`    | Chromosome of the first fragment     |
| `pos1`      | Genomic position of the first bin    |
| `chrom2`    | Chromosome of the second fragment    |
| `pos2`      | Genomic position of the second bin   |
| `count`     | Contact count |


#### 2. `label_info.pickle`

A Python pickle file (`.pickle`) that stores cell metadata, including cell type labels. It should be a dictionary with cell IDs as keys and their corresponding cell types as values.


 ```python
{
    'cell type': ['GM12878', 'GM12878', 'GM12878', ... , 'K562']
}
```


#### 3. `config.json`

A JSON configuration file specifying dataset-related parameters. Some of the required keys include:

```json
{
  "data_dir": "./",
  "temp_dir": "./Temp",
  "genome_reference_path": "./hg38.chrom.sizes",
  "chrom_list": ["chr1","chr2","chr3","chr4","chr5",
			  "chr6","chr7","chr8","chr9","chr10",
			  "chr11","chr12","chr13","chr14","chr15",
			  "chr16","chr17","chr18","chr19","chr20",
			  "chr21","chr22","chrX"],
  "resolution": 10000
}
```
